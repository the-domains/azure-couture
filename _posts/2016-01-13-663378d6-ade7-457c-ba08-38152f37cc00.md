The Invitation is more than just the tone-setter for your wedding. It's purpose reaches beyond the time tested ritual of creating, sending & receiving. It is a joyous montage of  style, tradition and tidings. It is an opportunity to call your community together in celebration of love. It is an archive of names, dates & places that will live in the memories of your guests as much as pressed between the pages of your wedding album. We believe that it should be created with meaningful design & artistry.
