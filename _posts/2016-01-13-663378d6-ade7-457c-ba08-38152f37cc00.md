The Invitation is more than just the tone-setter for your wedding. It's purpose lives beyond the ritual of creating, sending & receiving. It is essentially a montage of  joy, tradition and tidings. It is an opportunity to call your community together in joyous celebration of love. It is an archive of names, dates & places that will live in the memories of your guests as much as pressed between the pages of your wedding album. It should be created with meaningful artistry & impeccable style. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1c5bbb70-66ba-4c37-a0bf-8a45e2528c0e.jpg)
